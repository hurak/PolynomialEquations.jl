# PolynomialEquations

A Julia package for solving equations with univariate polynomials. Solvers for [linear (Diophantine) equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diophantine_equation#Linear_Diophantine_equations) (also called [Bezout identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zout%27s_identity)) in the ring of univariate polynomials and quadratic equations of special kind (also called spectral factorization) are (planned to be) provided.

!!! note "Equations with polynomials and not polynomial equations in real variables"
    The package does not offer functionality for solving nonlinear equations (with real variables), in which the nonlinearities come in the form of multivariate polynomials (in those real variables). Such functionality can be found elsewhere.
